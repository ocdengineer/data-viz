# data-viz
Data visualisation library.

- Aim is to build ready made charts similar to PowerBI
- See https://github.com/airbnb/visx, its D3 wrapped around react syntax. Used in place of d3 (in react) to make your own customisable charts. A similar alternative to visx in elm is https://github.com/gampleman/elm-visualization/tree/2.1.2
